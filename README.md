# magento shop automation tests

Project is dedicated to write few automated tests to check navigation bar, sorting the items and add/remove the items to/from the cart and place the order.

## Installation

For running tests it is needed to install Java. I use Maven project.
From the mvnrepository.com need to take dependencies:
 * Selenium;
 * Webdriver manager;
 * Chromedriver (if needed).

### Usage

For running the tests it is needed to clone the repository.
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/000ggg000/magento.git

Open MainPageTest class and run tests.
